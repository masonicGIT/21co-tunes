# 21co-tunes
Buy tracks from a BTC payable API endpoint

## Purchasing a track with the 21 Bitcoin Computer
1. ```git clone https://github.com/masonicGIT/21co-tunes```
2. ```cd 21co-tunes```
3. ```python3 client.py```
4. Select the track you wish to purchase

## Track Definition
21co-tunes need to be easily accessible via an API endpoint either by track name, album name, or artist name. 

### Track naming
A track naming standard like this may already exist...I didn't feel like Googling it

```<Artist Name> + ' ' + '-' + ' ' + <Album Name> + ' ' + '-' + ' ' + <Track Number> + ' ' + <Track name> + <File Extension>```

Ex: ```Jay Gupta Music - Welcome-To-LUTDs - 07 Touch The Screen.mp3```

##TODO
1.  Make track look up a bit more computer friendly.
2.  Make service locally hosted a la OpenBazaar. This must be literally peer-to-peer, artists -> consumers
3.  Only allow streams, would ideally be pay-per-stream (a nominal amount).
